### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    This lab is a favorite because it blends problem-solving with practical 
    programming skills, allowing me to build a functional spell checker 
    from scratch. It provides a hands-on experience with file I/O, string manipulation, 
    and algorithm design, which are essential for becoming proficient in C++. 
    Debugging and testing against real-world scenarios make it both challenging 
    and rewarding, giving a strong sense of accomplishment when the program passes all test cases.

* Lab 10

    This lab is a favorite because it combined core programming concepts 
    like file I/O, input validation, and control flow into a fun, interactive 
    guessing game. It challenged me to think critically about edge cases
    while reinforcing clean coding practices and debugging techniques. The two-player 
    aspect maked the project engaging, as one person sets the secret while the other 
    guesses, adding an element of surprise and collaboration.

* Lab 7

    This lab is my favorite because it challenges me to implement real-world 
    logic, like parking rules, in code, which is both practical and engaging.
    I love how it combines problem-solving and debugging while ensuring input 
    validation, making me feel like I'm creating a reliable program. Additionally,
    the clear step-by-step structure, with automated tests and error-checking,
    helps me build confidence in my programming skills.
